before you sit down to develop that first line of code, you need to consider the concern of publishing an app that can go to millions of personal devices

initial startup costs
--
business registration
equipment - dev machine, devices
licenses - dev tools, graphics design, stock images
accounting and legal fees

reasons to incorporate
--
need to secure financing
protect your personal liability

participate in gov funding programs (where applicable - ED)

app store accounts
--
apple: $99/usd/year individual
google pay: $25/usd one time
windows: $19/usd (one time) individual

invest in devices
--
at least one low end test device for each supported platform
test app performance, behaviors, touch capabilities, and appearances

protect your investment
--
github
tfs

the importance of an appealing UI
--
clean simple UI design
use stock images / mobile app templates
if possible, partner with a graphic designer

the planning phase
----

define your mobile roadmap
--
what is your app really going to do?
  main function
  purpose of app
target market
suppoted languages

choose a monetization strategy
--
paid
freemium
in-app purchases
in-app advertising
  doesn't really yield a big return

is it just a portfolio item? or an investment to make money through the future

analytics or bust?
--
analytics enable you to track
  application usage
  user demographics
  crash reports

hockeyapp
crashlytics
fabric
etc.

if your application...
--
collects personal information, including images, location tracking, device id
uses 3rd party services, such as analytics, in-app advertising etc
will be published to a public app store

you MUST include a privacy policy

how to obtain a privacy policy for your app
--
use an online privacy policy generator
iubenda.com/en/mobile
termsfeed.com/privacy-policy/generator
consult laywer

before you release the app to the store...
----

the importance of beta testers
--
searching for beta testers: betafamily.com
deploying to beta testers: hockeyapp.net
slide: keep calm and beta test

master the art of marketing
--
reach out to technical blogs
make use of social media

user feedback and support
--
setup social media accounts
include a support email link in app
setup an online portal to enable feedback and support (UserVoice, Fresh Desk)

schedule maintenance releases
--
address critical bugs
opportunity to include popular feature requests
updates appear as notifications, reminding users about your app

even if you have nothing to fix, add something new, do something, push out a maintenance release to remind users that you are working on it and that your app exists
