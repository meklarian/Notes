dockerizing asp.net 4.x apps

docker and containers

containers support existed in linux for a while
docker made them accessible
lightweight virtualization

virtual machines mandate including copies of the guest OS
containers abstract away the guest OS

linux containers architecture
--
operating system (bottom) -> docker engine (talks to linux services) >> rest api -> docker client / compose / swarm / etc

eliminate friction
--
separation of concerns between development and deployment

dockerfile
--
base image
install dependencies
build application
specify entry point

continuous delivery pipeline
--
[docker hub (top) <- docker image] >>> dev / QA / Production

that's linux but what about
--
webforms
mvc, webapi, signalR
dependencies that require full .net framework
don't want to port to .net core?

windows server containers
--
coming in windows server 2016
current version is technical preview 5
comes in 2 flavors: windows server, nano server
native support for containers
nano server: really stripped down version of windows that only supports .net core

windows containers architecture
--
operating system (bottom) -> docker engine (port of linux version, nearly exact codebase) >> rest api -> docker client / compose / swarm / etc

demo
--
docker images
> displays images
docker run --rm -it windowsservercore cmd
> launches interactive session with windowsservercore, launches cmd and connects

demo shows job ids connected inside the container, but container can't see outside

asp.net in containers
--
asp.net core (.net core): linux, windows, nano server
asp.net core (full framework): linux (mono), windows
web api, signalr (owin self-host): windows
webforms, mvc 5 (iis): windows

so.. what's the point of all this
----

docker all the things
--
manage and deploy everything with docker
run multiple .net versions on the same machine
no more intsalling dependencies on servers

mixed linux/windows clusters
--
docker swarm can manage a cluster that has some linux and some windows nodes
can give windows containers to docker swarm and it will know to provision them to windows machines

summary
--
docker and containers are a big deal
dockerize all asp.net applications
windows server containers coming 2nd half 2016
manage linux/windows containers with the same tools

next steps
--
try windows server 2016
azure container services windows private preview
