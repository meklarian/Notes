dvorak is a data-driven way to type, a simplified keyboard layout
a relative of the composer antonin dvorak

the biggest difference is the home row
because the most common letters are on the home row
all the vowels are on the left
consonants on the right
a balanced way to type
you get 10x more words from the home row (3000 in dvorak, 300 in qwerty)

went cold turkey, took about 6 weeks
