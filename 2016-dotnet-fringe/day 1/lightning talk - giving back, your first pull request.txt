giving back: your first pull request
ben hyrman & david glick

if you haven't done one already
you will soon
everything is open source now
want to give a talk to let people know it's not scary

example
--
dave is a maintainer for WYAM
  static site generated (like jekyll)
reason to talk about PRs is that his first sub to WYAM was a documentation PR

how does a PR work?
--
displaying: github for WYAM
fork the repo
make edits
submit pull request
