how to be more inclusive in tech
daniel plaisted

so what can we do?
--
recognize the problem
  implicit bias
  not necessarily aware of these
  but contributes to making people feel unwelcome

once we recognize the issue
  we can use this as an opportunity to learn and to grow

listen to diverse voices
  one of the most radical things you can do is to listen to women when they tell you about their experiences
  listening helps you understand how you can help

listen before speaking
  try to amplify diverse voices
  don't demand people explain things

assume everyone is as qualified as you are
  women have the problem that being identifiable in a dress makes people assume they are less skilled

boost the individual in their work
  if someone is under attack online
  boost them and identify their accomplishments
  give feedback based on content

be intentional about including others

use diverse people to represent the users of your software

speak up
