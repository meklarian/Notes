Communication is just as important as code

background as a marketer, learned programming after partnership at corgibytes

gave a lightning talk on polyglot development: here's another language you can learn >> English

on having skills: need to bridge being technical with the non-technical

what is communication?
--
the first thing to know is that it is rooted in empathy
empathy: developed by listening and understanding, applied by perspective-taking
a thing you have acquired after you have listened and truly understood where someobody else is coming from
being able to take the perspective of what myself, the people contributing to this project, we all need to be successful [5+ years from now]
empathy is a skill we can learn

another aspect, as events
--
axes:
synchronous ---- asynchronous
obvious ---- not obvious

obvious x synchronous
meetings, video calls, screenhero, phone calls

obvious x asynchronous
email, twitter, texts, stack overflow

centrist
slack

synchronous x not obvious
chit chat, eye contact, body language, punctuality

asynchrnous x not obvious
commit messages - document your code, your idea
naming
scenarios & tests
timesheets - as a business owner, we send our clients a report list of how much effort has been done per task and our commentary
PR comments - opportunity to describe our thinking
error messages
(source comments? - ED)

Communication - the artifacts of your ideas

Legacy Code - Code without Communication Artifacts
the reason legacy code is hard to work with is because there's no communication artifacts, no documentation, clutter, a mess, etc.
michael feathers defines legacy code as code without tests; this is kind of polarizing > gets into the debate of do we need to test vs not test, do we need 100% coverage, etc.
ex. like an archaeology - trying to get context (resurface context)
eg. bones, you can learn a lot about a culture from a culture
but also things like pottery, coins, foundations of buildings, writing
it is the combination of all of these artifacts that gives people insight into how the world was lived/worked in

why this *&*^ matters
--
if you want to level up your career, you need to learn how to communicate
if you want to be a CTO someday, you need to be able to communicate about the strategic direction of technology

building trust
--
think of trust also as artifacts
"trust as a marble jar" (needs citation, benet brown?) - teacher had a marble jar, when the class did well, a marble was placed in the jar, and when it got full, the class would have a pizza party
you build trust just the same, over time and incrementally

communication is essential if you want to have a culture where you are preventing fires instead of putting them out
maxim at corgibytes: control the ???

patterns & frameworks
--
"move slowly from one pattern to another" - joshua k???, something constantly moving towards

context switching - the struggle is real
marketing folks generally don't get it
interruptions eat mental models
(used example from inceptions)

use inception levels to gauge interruptibility

shattering glass - you'll be shocked how often you do this
be less like ted, more like tina (how i met your mother?)
in the show they talk about bad habits, and ted says "well actually"
"well actually" annoys marketers as much as "hey got a sec" annoys us
instead of saying "well actually" which is divisive
instead, "yes, and"
you can rephrase and get the same information across

how not to sound like a jerk
kim scott:
care personally (the give a damn axis) x challenge directly (how much am i willing to piss you off)

ruinous empathy          | radical candor
-----------------------------------------------
manipulative insincerity | obnoxious aggression

on how sheryl sandberg instructed kim scott to stop saying "um": "it makes you sound unauthoritive"

radical candor: humble, helpful, immediate, private-> criticism, public -> praise, don't personalize (don't dissect character, only contribution)

communication is a skill
you can learn it
i believe in you

list of books:
team of teams
present! a techie's guide to public speaking
bossypants
essentiation
thinking fast and slow
daring greatly
tongue fu!
thanks for the feedback!
