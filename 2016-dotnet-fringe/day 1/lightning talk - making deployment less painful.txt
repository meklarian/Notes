WPF app

used to ship slowly: ~6 times in 8 months

retrospective into why:
workflow interruptions
installer was bad
extremely painful to be bottlenecked by the installer
unable to get fast feedback from customers

investigate a background installer

found out an installer called squirrel, does background updates

decision: do we build our own?

result: we did

called: bobcat

two key things: improved customer experience, developer process was a lot nicer
made shipping part of the developer workflow

not open source yet but will be by the end of the Q
