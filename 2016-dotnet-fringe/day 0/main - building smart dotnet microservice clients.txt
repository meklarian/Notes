--
how to host a pure js client in a .net core 1.0 web app
how to write a simple js client that consumes .net usvcs
how to build react js web applications in a .net core world
how to implment a simple spa middleware for .net core 1.0
how to incorporate react-router into a react application

what will not be covered
--
how to build microservices
http://teamjohnston.net/blog/category/microservices/
how to build isomorphic js applications
how to become a webpack expert
how to take over the world

--
latest node (5.0+) and npm (3.0+)

git client
client IDE (vs code)

git repo
--
https://github.com/beaupalmquist-hdqc/microservice-client-workshop-2016

vanilla js
react
react-router
redux

each project category contains two projects, one that is the complete project and the other that is the starter project
we will be working with the starter projects
.net core class library that contains middleware for hosting a SPA in .net core

the monolithic web application
--
one project to rule them all (contains)
business logic
views
controllers
data models
view models
scripts

what are microservices
--
a logically connected group of web apis
hosted independently from the consuming web app
more granular and scalable than a monolithic web app end

microservices in .net
--
asp.net provides a generic web api platform
oriented to building a monolithic web application

no constraints in webapi projects to adhere to usvc principles

forge microservice framework
--
built at home depot over the last year
forge team: jessejohnston, beau palmquist, jared schaab
based on asp.net core 1.0 middleware
platform infrastructure is built on usvcs
- deployment
- routing
- identity and security
provider-based and technology-agnostic

lab #1: vanilla js web app
simplest client we can write

using https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb

from slack channel:
Here’s an example of using a `hosting.json` file to configure your port number: https://github.com/smashdevcode/microservice-client-workshop-2016/commit/906139175e4f214e6a3d5f6139329a2611317ba8
