10 years of json dot net
james newton-king

it's been 10 years since the first release of json.net
looking back over what can be done to make open source enjoyable and healthy

initially started as backend support for an asp.net web form control
needed a way to retrieve data from the server for the js-based control
initially used xml as data format and transport
  discovered it was verbose and kind of slow
learned about javascript object literals
  but then found js literal tricky to write on the page from asp.net

initially thought of open source as something that you write once and then move on
but changed when he moved source code to codeplex
codeplex offered issue tracking, source code, feature requests
and he discovered that a community had sprung up around json.net

lots has changed since then for opensource and .net
  github - code contributions, distributed source control
  nuget - seeing your project be used, getting downloads and stats
  techempower - drive to be better/faster, benchmark comparisons
  twitter - being told you're doing it wrong, social networking (crowd laughs - ED)

how can we increase the .net OSS community
  grow the number of developers, will grow the number of contributors
    slide: transition from a pie chart with a thin slice, to a larger pie with the same slice %
  increase the % of people involved in open source
    slide: transition from a pie chart with a thin slice, to a pie with a larger slice %
  ms has also started putting resources into nuget and github
  tooling is cheap/free now with vs code and vs community edition

editorial
  would like to see codeplex sunset
    should move to github
    stop new projects
    codeplex is like google+
      you can send party invites, don't expect anyone to show up
    automatically redirect visitors to github
    future: read-only
  would like to change the microsoft MVP program
    traditionally given to, well, loud people (people who wrote books, blogs, etc.)
    but there's really no such thing as a MVP in open source
    scott hanselman introduced the idea of an open source MVP
    could be a place to highlight significant .NET open source contributions
     e.g. Ben Adams - increased Kestrel performance by X million requests/sec
          Jon Hanna - top 5 contributor to .net core fx
  integration between sites
    on nuget page
      show stack overflow questions or tally
      github repo information
    "sometimes the only way to determine if a package is good or not is by its download count" (paraphrased - ED)
  integration in visual studio
    right click on an assembly
      open in stackoverflow
      open in github
      open in slack (chatroom)
      with .net core, potentially: clone project
        being able to edit locally in one motion and fix bugs may lead to making it easier to get more bugs fixed upstream
