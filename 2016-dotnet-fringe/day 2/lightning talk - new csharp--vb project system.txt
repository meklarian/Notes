goipng to talk about the editing experience in visual studio
the whole point is to allow you to do it in your fav text editor as well

slide: one does not simply edit msbuild files
can edit by hand, but if you want to make from scratch- you're screwed
slide: do it
there's a way to do it

slide: project file for msbuild, xml based
  can remove namespaces
  can remove xml prolog
  etc.
  audience: remove the xml (laughs - ED)
  can get rid of project guids

slide: let's see this again

demo: side by side demo (wow - ED)
  modifying project file from within visual studio in another editor (vs code)
    vs automatically updates, no warning or complaints
