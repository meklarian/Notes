what is hadoop?
--
a data processing framework 10 years in the making
can mean different things depending on the context
written entirely in java
started as a framework for writing applications using the mapreduce pattern

design
--
code is pushed to the data
core pieces are hdfs, a distributed file system & YARN, the cluster resource management system
data needs to be loaded into HDFS first before performing any processing
results can be written back to HDFS or a different destination
client applications can be written in any language with the streaming feature

HDFS write
--
typical replication factor is 3

data nodes send heartbeats to the main node


YARN
--
resource manager to manage the use of resources across a cluster
node managers running on all nodes in a cluster
containers running in NMs where the code gets shipped to
resource manager & namenode can be co-located
node managers run on DataNodes

demo
--
configuring YARN xml file
setting up cluster locally
dashboard

roadmap
--
Core - IO, HDFS, YARN
Custom datatypes
implement an orchestrator [zookeeper]
extensions for azure, aws, openstack, et al

slide/caption: need your help!
