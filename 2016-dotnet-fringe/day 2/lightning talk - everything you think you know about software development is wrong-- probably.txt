graph: accuracy of estimate vs time (convergence)
laurent bossavit #leprechauns
the leprechauns of software development
found this graph went back to 1981 (barry boone? ***Barry W Boehm*** - ED)
"these ranges have been determined subjectively, and are intended to represent 80% confidence limits that is within a factor of four on either side, 80% of the time"

graph: cost of finding and fixing defects increases over time (cost exponential vs time)
Boehm again: 1981, from a paper (completely different graph, jagged, the bottom curve is the cost of fixing defects, which is not exponential but a sawtooth, and also goes out to 11th week, not years)
11th week was when his team would do acceptance testing
the exponential graph is not an intrinsic value of software development, but a side effect of your development process
