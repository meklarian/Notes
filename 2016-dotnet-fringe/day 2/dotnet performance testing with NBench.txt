.NET Performance Testing with NBench
aaron stannard
CEO, Petabridge, Founder NBench (and also akka.net? - ED)

performance testing historically has been hard to do
  requires understanding how your application works at a low level

a performance story
--
akka.net
slide: akka.remote performance over time
  in 12/2015 someone checked in a change that made performance suffer
how quick is akka.remote

defensive programming
--
no sudden negative changes
memory consumption
  on a mobile device, memory is at a premium
total throughput
garbage collection overhead
  if you have a lot of g2 gc and you're not using server gc, this can cause big pauses (20s+)
I/O
# of network calls
shared resource contention

performance lifecycle management
--
determining performance constraints 
  -> identify performance critical path
  -> set targets
  -> measure against target
  -> update performance history
    (having a single source of truth in performance history allows developers to contribute to the conversation with a common benchmark)

where nbench belongs
--
nbench belongs in this area:
  -> measure against target
  -> update performance history

performance testing is hard
--
why performance testing is hard
  os unpredictability
    scheduling
    virtual memory
      (if you use a benchmark that consumes a lot of virt memory, stuff will start getting paged to disk)
    other processes
  hardware variability
    cache pinning
    CISC optimizations
  runtime & dependencies
    GC
    JIT
    Downstream changes
  Metrics
    platform dependencies
    instrumentation challenges
  difficult to design isolated tests    

NBench Features
--
feels just like writing a unit test
writes output to files
reliable, believeable data
fast
configurable
extensible
OSS (apache 2)

demo
--
nbench has run modes, iteration counts, test modes
  speaker recommends prime numbers for iteration counts to avoid triggering CPU optimizations like intel's even-numbered pipelining
nbench uses attributions to label tests
  PerfBenchmarkAttribute
  MemoryMeasurementAttribute
    MemoryMetric, with Constraints bounded by ByteConstants, etc.
  CounterMeasurementAttribute
  GcMeasurementAttribute
output from NBench is a markdown file
  speaker uses sublime text to read the output formatted
