introduction to avalonia
steven kirk

what is avalonia
--
cross platform ui framework
formerly called perspex
based on wpf/xaml etc (where it made sense)
brings them up-to-date
  new language features (linq, async/await)
  uses modern patterns such as Rx
  adds proven features from other places (eg web development)
currently in late alpha - beta this year?

cross platform
--
we have two subsystems
  windowing
  rendering
on windows we use win32/direct2d
on linux and mac we use GTK/cairo
in the process of moving from cairo to Skia (via Skia#)
experimental support for iOS/android

based on wpf/XAML
--
we use xaml
not tied to XAML, our aim is for XAML to be just another markup
basic visual studio visualizer

xaml improvements
--
binding to controls
  WPF
    <TextBox Text="{Binding ElementName=other, Path=Text}" />
  Avalonia
    <TextBox Text="{Binding #other.Text}" />

binding negation
  Avalonia
    <TextBlock IsVisible="{Binding Loading}">Loading...</TextBlock>
    <!-- ED Note: can't read comment but I think it says negation is possible on binding expression -->
    <ContentPresenter Content="{Binding}" IsVisible="{Binding !Loading}"> ... </ContentPresenter>

CSS-like styling
--
a pain-point of WPF is styling
  can only have one style per control
  BasedOn is limiting
the idea of CSS (although junk in places) has been proven
  we use a mixture of the two approaches

<Style Selector="TextBlock.h1">
  <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="#212121" />
  <Setter Property="FontSize" Value="20" />
  <Setter Property="FontWeight" Value="Medium" />
</Style>
...
<TextBlock Classes="h1">A Header</TextBlock>

rx for binding
--
we use rx for binding
get observable for property:
  var o = textBox.GetObservable(TextBox.TextProperty);
bind properties to observable (this probably has a small syntax error? - ED)
  var o = textBox.GetObservable(TextBox.TextProperty)
    .Select(x => "Hello " + x);
  textBox2.Bind(TextBlock.TextProperty, o);

left to do
--
item virtualization has just been added - needs stabilizing
rewrite of rendering - we render the whole scene on every frame right now
bring skia up to parity
missing controls
improve designer
.net core support
performance and memory usage
