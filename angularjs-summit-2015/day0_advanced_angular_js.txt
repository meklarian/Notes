*** what is angularJS?

is a framework for dynamic web apps
uses HTMl as your template language
extends HTML's symtax creating new HTML constructs
has databinding and dependency injection
happens within the browser client-side MVC/MVW

*** angularJS creates new HTML syntax

** examples
data binding, as in {{}}.
DOM control structures for repeating/hiding DOM fragments (ng-repeat, ng-show, ng-hide)
support for forms and form validation
attaching new behavior to DOM elements, such as DOM event handling (ng-click)
groups HTML into reuseable components

** angular is a complete client-side solution

handles all of the DOM and AJAX
opinionated way to create a CRUD application giving you:
data-binding
basic templating directives
form validation
routing
deep-linking
reuseable components
dependency injection

*** angularJS focuses on Testability

unit-testing
end-to-end testing
mocks
harnesses - to test under varying conditions

*** opinionated high level abstraction

** angularjs believes
declarative code is better than imperative for UI and connecting code
writing tests is as important as writing code
decouple the client side from the server side
framework should include UI, logic, testing
make the common trivial
make the difficult possible

*** angular JS frees you from

registering callbacks, reducing boilerplate clutter
manipulating DOM programmatically
marshalling data to and from the UI
writing a lot of initialization code

*** simple examples

https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts
http://angularjs.org

*** angularjs sources:

bower install
code.angularjs.org
** CDNs:
developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#angularjs
cdnjs.com/libraries/angular.js

*** Concepts

template - html with additional markup
directives - extend HTML with custom attributes and elements
model - the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
scope - context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives, and expressions can access it
expression - access variables and functions from the scope
compiler - parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions
filter - formats the value of an expressino for display to the user
view - what the user sees (the DOM)
data binding - sync data between the model and the view
controller - the business logic behind views
dependency injection - creates and wires objects and functions
injector - dependency injection container
module - a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, directives; which configures the injector
service - reuseable business logic independent of views

*** simplified workflow

ng-app directive bootstraps angularJs
ng-init - initis model before template is rendered
directives are custom HTML tags & attributes
directives add dynamic behavior
{{ expression }} outputs model values
ng-model allows for 2-way data binding
changes in model are propagated to template

*** the super powers

teach a browser how to interpret new HTML tags and attributes
dependency injection (DI)
/ DI makes it easy to assemble a web application from smaller, thoroughly tested services.
open source project hosted on GitHub
/ https://github.com/angular/angular/js

*** Tools

great IDEs make life easier
/ JetBrains WebStorm (and others)
/ sublime, textmate, atom, brackets
command line tools:
/ node.js
/ bower
/ yeoman
testing
/ karma
/ jasmine / mochaJS
/ protractor
/ angular batarang / ng-inspector

*** tools (cont)

jsFiddle, Plunker, CodePen
ngDocs (android app with documentation)
angularUI - collection of UI components
/ ui-router
/ ui-map / UI-Gmap
/ ui-calendar
/ UI bootstrap - native bootstrap in Angular
ng-table - sorting and filtering table
restangular - easier get/delete/update and post
ngmodules.org

*** advantages of angularJS

reduction in the number of lines of code needed
templating with two-way data binding
vibrant and supportive community
has its own set of idioms, patterns, and best practices
doesn't require an explicit DOM refresh
/ angular JS is capable of tracking
// user actions
// browser events
// model changes

*** Controllers

constructor functino used to augment Scope
new child scope available as injectable $scope
sets initial state of scope
adds behaviour to scope
DO NOT
/ manipulate DOM (business logic only)
/ format input - use angular form controls instead
filter output - use angular filters instead
share code or state across controllers - services instead

*** Controllers

move logic/data init out of the html/template
ng-controller & scope examples:
/ classic $scope

(index.html)
```
<body ng-app"app">
<div ng-controller="HelloCtrl">
Say hello to:
<input type="text" ng-model="name" /><br />
	<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>
</div>
</body>
```

(app.js)
```
angular.module('app', [])
.controller('HelloCtrl', function($scope) {
	$scope.name = 'World';
});
```

*** "Controller as" syntax

introduced in Angular 1.2
now considered a best practice...
naming of controllers allows nesting (mode later)
forces use of dot.syntax (prevents some issues)

(index.html)
```
<body ng-app="app">
<div ng-controller="HelloController as hello">
Say hello to:
<input type="text" ng-model="hello.name" /><br />
	<h1>Hello, {{hello.name}}!</h1>
</div>
</body>
```

(app.js)
```
angular.module('app', [])
.controller('HelloController', function() {
var hello = this;
hello.name = 'World';
});
```

*** more examples

https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts
https://angularjs.org

*** angularJS bootstrap process

web app URI request is made
angular.js is downloaded
bootstrap callback is registered by angular.js
HTML page is fully downloaded and callback is executed
angular traverses the dom tree to find ng-app directive
angular locates the element containing the ng-app directive and defines it as the root of the app's DOM
injector used for dependency injection is created
injector creates the root scope object ($rootScope) that will become the context for the app's model
angular compiles the DOM by starting at the ngApp root, then processes directives and bindings as it works its way down the tree
once bootstrapped, angular waits for browser events taht might change the model
when an event occurs, angular checks for a change to the model
if changes to the model are found, angular updates the affected bindings within the view

*** scope

contains the data model
glue between the controller and the view
context for expressions in templates
have hierarchal structure that mimics dom
scopes calss can watch expressions and propagate events
Scope.$watch observes model mutations
Scope.$apply tells view to re-example model for changes
directive set up $watch on scope during linking

recommendation: call $apply to let angular know that you manipulated scope variables outside of NG scope
recommendation: wrap jQuery UI components in directives

*** directives
markers on DOM elements, attributes, classes, ...
tell $compile service to create special behavior
built-in directives:
/ ng-app
/ ng-init
/ ng-controller
/ ng-model
/ ng-bind
/ ng-class
/ ng-repeat
/ ng-show
/ ng-hide
and you can create your own directives

*** ng-repeat directive
instantiates a scope per item from a collection
loop variable is set to the current collection item
$index is set to the item index, or key
following booleans are also available
/ $first
/ $middle
/ $last
/ $even
/ $odd
syntax:
/ ng-repeat=
// country in countries
// (key, value) in storeObj (order is unreliable)
example: http://plnkr.co/edit/0134iPSdMxPTlCcOQulG?p=preview
with batarang: http://run.plnkr.co/jfdCil5aLd5AhBle/

*** scope hierarchy and inheritance

controllers create a new scpoe
be careful of scoping errors!

(js)
```
var app = angular.module('app', []);
app.controller('HelloCtrl',
function($scope) {
}
);
```

(html)
```
<body ng-app"app" ng-init="name='World'">
<h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
<div ng-controller="HelloCtrl">
Say hello to:
	<input type="text" ng-model="name" />
<h2>Hello, {{name}</h2>
</div>
</body>
```

*** scope hierarchy & events

hierarchial scopes can be used as an event bus
dispatch named events with a payload using:
/ upwards via $scope.$emit
/ downwards via $scope.$broadcast

(js, request to listen to core $broadcast event)
$scope.$on('$locationChangeSuccess', function(event, newUrl, oldUrl) {
// react on the location change here
// ex: update breadcrumbs based on newUrl
});

rec: can also preventDefault to suppress bubbling of events, etc.

*** scope hierarchy & events (cont)

angularjs framework only emits three events:
/ $includeContentRequested
/ $includeContentLoaded
/ $viewContentLoaded
and, only seven events being broadcast:
/ $locationChangeStart
/ $locationChangeSuccess
/ $routeUpdate
/ $routeChangeStart
/ $routeChangeSuccess
/ $routeChangeError
/ $destroy
use sparingly, evaluate other options
/ two-way data binding

*** scope lifecycle

hierarchial scopes help in managing memory
directives create and destroy scopes
/ Scope.$destroy, Scope.$new
destroyed scopes can be garbage collected
you can manually create and destroy scopes
/ this is extremely useful for testing

*** view

angularjs is not just a templating language
unique ability to automatically refresh screen
angular's html compiler traverses DOM
compile: collect all directives to produce linking function
link: combine directives with scope to produce live view
most other templating languages: (one way data binding, one time merge of template/model to view)

*** two-way data binding

two-way data binding

template -> [view <-> model]

template is compiled
changes to view update model, changes to model update view
continuous updates allow model to be single-source-of-truth

*** declarative vs imperative

angularJS philosophy of building UIs: http://plnkr.co/edit/1DgQNfh5h2OBCrjNJwBB?p=preview
templates describe a desired effect
/ not how to achieve it
DOM elements:
/ we don't keep references to them
/ not obliged to manipulate them explicitly
view changes based on model mutation
directives enable this:
/ ng-model, ng-click, ng-class, ng-show, ng-hide

*** modules

angularJS defines global angular namespace
various utility functions:
/ angular.boostrap, angular.injector, angular.module
module is a container for angularJS objects
/ controllers, services, factories, animations, etc.
module.controller requires:
/ name (as string), constructor function (avoids use of new keyword)
ng-app has to be set to the module name!

*** dependency injection

declaratively describe dependencies among objs
where does $scope come from?
/ angularJS sees that scope is needed for controller
/ it then creates a new scope and injects it!
angularJS' dependency injection engine can:
/ see a need for a collaborating object
/ find the collaborator
/ wire up the objects into a functioning application
being able to swap collaborators allows us to:
/ create a different application with existing code
/ unit test components effectively

*** DI-registering services

angularJs can only wire up objects it is aware of
we need to register an object for DI to work
/ actually registering constructor functions.
DI can instantiate objects & wire them up
$provide service does registration
$injector service provides object instances
/ all dependencies are resolved & injected

*** DI - $provide

services are created by a service factory
service factories are created by service providers
service providers $get holds the service factory functions available on Module!
/ provider(provider) - registers a service provider with the $injector
/ constant(obj) - registers a value/object that can be accessed by providers and services
/ value(obj) - registers a value/object that can only be accessed by services, not providers
/ factory(fn) - registers a service factory function, fn, that will be wrapped in a service provider object, whose $get property will contain the given factory function.
/ service(class) - registers a constructor fuction, class, that will be wrapped in a service provider object, whose $get property will instantiate a new object using the given constructor function

*** DI - value & constant

easiest ways to manage an object
/ Module.value(name, value);
/ Module.constant(name, value);
registers a pre-instantiated item with $injector
/ string, number, array, object, or function
$get is a factory with no arguments
/ returns value service or constant service accordingly
constants
/ cannot be overridden by decorator
/ get applied before other provide methods
/ can be injected into module.config

*** DI - service

service(name, constructor);
/ register a service constructor which is invoked with new
/ constructor creates the service instance
services can have other dependencies!
/ constants and values cannot
provider's $get property is the service constructor
service - method of registration
service - singleton obj managed by AngularJS DI

*** DI - factory

factory(name, $getFn);
more flexible than service
/ we can register any arbitrary object-creating function
services can be written as factory, but not all factories can be written as a service
most commonly used AngularJS DI method
regular functions
/ we can simulate private variables
/ hide implementation of a service

*** DI - provider

function that returns an obj containing $get
/ $get is a factory function
/ $get returns a service instance
provider(name, provider);
/ registers provider function with $injector
service providers end with Provider (((convention??)))
/ the $log service's service provider is $logProvider
provider objs can potentially be configured
/ ex. $logProvider has method debugEnabled
all other $provide methods are syntactic sugar

*** module loading & dependencies

providers can be configured before construction
modules ahve 2 types of blocks to support this
/ configuration blocks - executed during provider config
// only providers & constants can be injected
/ run blocks - executed after injector is created
// kickstarts the application
// only instances & constants can be injected

(js example)
```
angular.module('myModule', [])
.config(function(injectables) { // provider-injector (((injection?)))
}).
run(function(injectables) { // instance-injector (((see above)))
});
```

*** module convenience methods

(js)
```
angular.module('myModule', [])
.value('a', 123)
.factory('a', function() {return 123;})
.directive('directiveName', ...)
.filter('filterName', ...);

// is the same as

angular.module('myModule', [])
.config(function($provide, $compileProvider, $filterProvider) {
$provide.value('a', 123);
$provide.factory('a', function(){return 123;});
$compileProvider.directive('directiveName', ...);
$filterProvider.register('filterName', ...);
});
```

*** modules can depend on other modules

angular takes care of inter-module dependencies
group related services into one module
/ potentially creating re-useable service libraries
module dependencies need to be loaded before
/ their config executes before dependent modules
/ their run blocks execute first as well
/ modules only load once (even with many dependences)
angular.module('app', ['dependency'])
modules can form their own hierarchy
step 1: http://plnkr.co/edit/QBFUSAROzYXxT9zE3e9u?p=preview
step 2: http://plnkr.co/edit/QUyrpHVC2gUpFOmuSiRM?p=preview

*** service scope

service is visible to all other modules
/ hierarchy of modules doesn't affect visibility of services
services are defined across all modules, globally
service names need to be unique
/ we can depend on a module and override a service
step 3: (services override) http://plnkr.co/edit/TfSSdOnIMbhOS3JRdwYa?p=preview

    };
  });

angular.module('engines', [])
  .factory('dieselEngine', function() {
    return {
      type: 'diesel'
    };
  });

```

*** jQuery and AngularJS

jqLite is a simplified version of jQuery included
/ angularJS can work with no dependency on an external lib
// if jQuery is loaded first, it will be substituted for jqLite
using jQuery plug-ins with AngularJS
/ can be difficult
/ both want to own the DOM
/ ideally you need to wrap jQuery plug-ins in a directive
/ or, find a substitute Angular directive

*** AngularJS influence on standards

Object.observe (ECMAScript7)
/ enables Declarative programming in pure JS
/ Chrome & Node have implemented
Web Components
/ reuseable widgets
/ similar to AngularJS components
/ incorporated into AngularJS 2.x

*** communicating with a Back-end

angularJS is ready to create CRUD style apps using the Promise interface
$http service for XMLHttpRequest & JSONP
$q service implements Promise API for asynchronous requests
$resource service targets RESTful endpoints

*** dealing with Associations

get all accounts belonging to a customer
/ GET /customers/456/accounts
create new account for specific customer
/ POST /customers/456/accounts
relationships can be complex, so don't nest too deeply
add ability to add optional attributes with HTTP ?:
/ GET /customers?state=NY&city=New%20York

*** $http service

angularJS XmlHttpRequest API with Promise ;)
/ returns a promise object with the standard then method and two http specific methods: success and error

(js)
```
$http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl', config: {...})
.success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
// this callback will be called asynchronously
// when the response is available
})
.error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
// called asynchronously if an error occurs
// or server returns response with an error status
});
```

shortcut methods on $http:
/ get, head, post, put, delete, jsonp, patch

*** $http configuration object

some of the configuration object properties:
/ method: HTTP method to be issued
/ url: URL to be targeted with a request
/ params: parameters to be added to the URL query string
/ headers: additional headers to be added to a request
/ timeout: timeout (in ms) after wich a XHR request will be dropped
/ cache: enables XHR GET request caching
/ transformRequest,transformResponse: transformation functions that allow us to pre-process content

*** $http example with live database

(js)
```
angular.module('app', [])
 .controller('AppCtrl', function($http) {
 var userToAdd = {name: 'Daniel Zen', email: 'daniel@zendigital.com'};
 $http.post('https://api.mongolab.com/api/1/databases/zendigital/collections/users',
 userToAdd, {params: {apiKey: 'AYbi4ibES9BvBeoIT4ldzkvszZK1JQqy'}})
 .success(function(data, status, headers, config) {...})
 .error(function(data, status, headers, config) {...});
 });
```

illustrates HTTP query string parameters
/ apiKey
see: https://mongolab.com/databases/zendigital

*** $httpProvider - Setting HTTP Headers

$http automatically adds certain HTTP headers
configured via $httpProvider.defaults.headers

```
$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common (headers that are common for all requests):
	Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post (header defaults for POST requests):
	Content-Type: application/json
$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put (header defaults for PUT requests):
	Content-Type: application/json
```

can also be set at runtime via $http.defaults

```
module.run(function($http) {
	$http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w';
});
```

*** Promise API & $q

in a synchronous world
/ pass the results of one function to another
/ handle exceptions with try/catch is straightforward
asynchronous world
/ we need to rely on callbacks
/ handling exceptions becomes difficult
solution: promise API
/ promise; eventual result of an asynchronous operation
/ $q inspired by Kris Kowal's Q Promise API libary
// REF: https://github.com/kriskowal/q
/ $http, $timeout, & other ng rely on it

*** working with Promises & $q

promise.then(onSuccess, onFailure, onNotify).finally(onFinal, onNotify);
/ onSuccess, onFailure: functions with 1 parameter
// onSuccess called when task is successful
// onFailure called if task fails to execute
// only one is called!
deferred object: var deferred = $q.defer();
/ has promise property (var promise = deferred.promise; ...)
/ methods:
// resolve(value), reject(reason), notify(value)
promises
/ live up to their name
/ can be used with $http

*** $q.all & $q.when

$q.all
/ start multiple async tasks
/ aggregates promises
/ resolves only when all of the tasks complete
/ if any one action fails, the aggregate promise will be rejected

$q.when
/ wraps a javascript object as a promise

*** $http with Promises

$http returns a promise and 2 convenience methods

(js, convenience methods example)
```
$http.get(urlResource)
.success(function(data) {
 $scope.value = data;
})
.error(function(data, status) {
 console.error('Error', status, data);
})
.finally(function() {
 console.log("finally finished");
});
```

(js, promise methods)
```
$http.get(urlResource)
.then(function(response) {
 $scope.value = response.data;
})
.catch(function(response) {
 console.error('Error',
 response.status, response.data);
})
.finally(function() {
 console.log("finally finished");
});
```

*** common persistence practice

crud - create, read, update, and delete

each letter in the acronym can map to a standard SQL statement and HTTP method

Operation : SQL : HTTP
Create : INSERT : PUT/POST
Read : SELECT : GET
Update : UPDATE : PUT / PATCH
Delete : DELETE : DELETE

*** common persistence practices

restful apis - representational state transfer

the name "representational state transfer" is intended to evoke an image of how a well-design web application behaves: a network of web pages forms a virtual state machine, allowing a user to progress through the application by selecting a link or submitting a short data-entry form, with each action resulting in a transition to the next state of the application by transferring a representation of that state to the user. - Roy Fielding

http 1.1 based on REST

*** Web API design

nouns are good, verbs are bad
/ pluarals are better (some use singular & plural)
start with 2 urls
/ collection /accounts or /customers
/ specifics /accounts/123 or /customers/456
look at tools to help you create your API
/ http://swagger.io
/ https://apiary.io
/ http://apigee.com

*** common persistence practices

resource : POST/create : GET/read : PUT/update : DELETE/delete
/accounts : create a new account : list accounts : bulk update accounts : delete all accounts
/accounts/123 : error : show account 123 : if exists update account 123, if not error : delete account 123
/customers : create a new customer : list customers : bulk update customers : delete all customers
/customers/456 : error : show customer 456 : if exists update customer 456, if not error : delete customer 456

ED: POST to a specific ID is not always an error or invalid action. ex: highly independent sharding, like tweets + snowflake ID generation, credit card user-side activity tokens

*** $resource - make REST easier

$resource(url, [paramDefaults], [actions], options);
factory lets you interact with server-side data
returns resource with methods for CRUD operations: get, save, query, remove, delete
operations can be invoked by the following:
/ http GET "class" actions: Resouce.action([parameters], [success], [error])
/ non-GET "class" actions: Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])
/ non-GET instance actions: instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])

*** $resource - a higher level abstraction

doesn't use promises, but...
you can also access the raw $http promise via the $promise property on the object returned

(js)
```
var User = $resource('/users/:userId',{userId:'@id'});
 User.get({userId:123})
 .$promise.then(function(user) {
 $scope.user = user;
 });
```

what is @id as passed to $resource? @ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17559515/what-is-id-as-passed-to-resource

*** $resource example

(js)
```
 .factory('Users', function ($resource) {
 var Users = $resource('https://api.mongolab.com/api/1/databases/zendigital/collections/users/:id',
 {id: '@_id.$oid’});
 })
 .controller('ResourceCtrl', function ($scope, Users) {
 $scope.users = Users.query({}, function(users){
 console.log($scope.users.length);
 });
 $scope.remove = function (user, index) {
 $scope.users.splice(index, 1);
 Users['delete']({}, user);
 };
 $scope.add = function () {
 var user = new Users({
 name:username
 });
 };
 });
```

*** Restangular - uses promises

angularJS service simplifies GET, DELETE, UPDATE

GET /accounts

(js)
```
Restangular.all('accounts').getList().then(
function(accounts) {
scope.accounts = accounts;
});
```

(js)
```
$scope.accounts = Restangular.all('accounts').getList().$object;
```

ref: ng-newsletter article @ http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/restangular.html

*** restangular

allows you to intercept object
extend/decorate object to add behavior / mix-in

(js)
```
angular.module(‘pa.services’, [‘restangular’]).
 factory(‘AccountSvc’, function(Restangular) {
 Restangular. extendModel(‘accounts’, function(acct) {
 return angular. extend(acct, {
 profit: function() {
 return this.revenue().minus(this.cost()));
 },
 revenue: function() {
 return this.price()
 .convertTo(this.internalCurrency));
 },
…
});
 return Restangular.all(‘accounts’);
})
;
```

*** displaying and formatting data

interpolate directive
/ <span>{{ expression }}</span>
/ {{}} delimiter is configurable in $interpolateProvider
/ can be escaped with \backslash
/ HTML markup in expression will be escaped
/ one-time binding now available with {{::expression}}
/ REF: http://plnkr.co/edit/n4jR9GkF1yXsSHZzWVHM?p=preview

ng-Bind equivalent
/ <span ng-bind="expression"></span>
/ can prevent initial template flicker (like ng-cloak)
/ you can request that html in expression not be escaped:
// <p ng-bind-html="msg"></p>
// done in a secure way (SCE: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$sce#show-me-an-example-using-sce- )
*** conditional display

4 sets of directives to show & hide parts of DOM
/ ng-show
/ ng-hide
/ ng-switch-*
/ ng-if
/ ng-include
ng-show/ng-hide use CSS "display: none;"
/ <div ng-show="showSecret">Secret</div>
/ <div ng-hide="!showSecret">Secret</div>
ng-switch adds DOM nodes conditionally
(html)
```
<div ng-switch on="showSecret">
	<div ng-switch-when="true">Secret</div>
	<div ng-switch-default>Won't show you my secrets!</div>
</div>
```
/ <div ng-if="showSecret">Secret</div>
/ <div ng-include="user.admin && 'edit.admin.html' || 'edit-user.html'"> ... </div>

*** ng-repeat directive

constantly monitors the source data to re-render
ng-repeat="user in users"
/ loop variable user is set to the current collection item
/ $index is set to the item index
booleans available: $first, $middle, $last, $even, $odd
iterating over an object's properties:

(html)
```
<li ng-repeat="(key, value) in object">
 Property {{$index}}: {{key}} has value {{value}}
</li>
```

keys are sorted, but don't rely on it (ref: http://jsfiddle.net/danielzen/8j3h1kbn/ )

*** ng-class, ng-class-even / ng-class-odd

ng-class-even, ng-class-odd used in ng-repeat
/ take effect only on odd/even rows
ng-class expression works in 3 ways
/ if string: one or more space-delimited class names
/ if object: key-value pairs. keys are classes used if truthy
/ if array: each element can be a string or object above

*** DOM event handlers

click events: ng-click & ng-dblclick
<input ng-model="name">
<button ng-click="hello(name)">Say hello!<button>

mouse events:
/ ng-mousedown, ng-mouse-up, ng-mouseenter, ng-mouseleave, ng-mousemove, and ng-mouseover

keyboard events:
/ ngKeydown, ngKeyup, ngKeypress

input change event: ng-change
/ cooperates with ng-model, to react on user input

*** $event

DOM event handlers can accept $event
allows access to lower level properties of event
/ prevent default action, stop propagation, etc
read position of a clicked element:

(html)
```
<li ng-repeat="item in items" ng-click="logPosition(item, $event)" >
 {{item}}
</li>
$scope.readPosition = function (item, $event) {
 console.log(location: ' + $event.clientX + ',' + $event.clientY );
};

```

*** filters - Model transformation

used for formatting data displayed to the user
there are some built-in filters (& custom ones: http://plnkr.co/edit/XrLLE59JnIwy11gM191R?p=preview ):

filter - selects a subset of items from an array and returns a new array
currency - formats a number as a currency (ex: $1,234.56). When no currency symbol is provided, default symbol for current locale is used
number - formats a number as text
date - formats date to a string based on the requested foramt
json - allows you to convert a javascript object into a JSON string
lowercase - converts a string to lowercase
uppercase - converts a string to uppercase (example: http://plnkr.co/edit/JOmT3GzYEVv1UExHpNQM?p=preview )
limitTo - creates a new array or string containing only a specified number of elements. the elements are taken from either the beginning or the end of the source array, string, or number, as specified by the value and sign (positive/negative) of limit. if a number is used as input, it is converted to a string (((???)))
orderBy - orders a specified array by the expression predicate. it is ordered alphabetically for strings and numerically for numbers. note: if you notic e numbers are not being sorted correctly, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.

*** forms

in a standard html form, the value of an input element is the value that will be sent to the server on submission of the form

angularJS decouples the model from the view.
data submited does not have to be the same as the data entered.

*** user information form example

(html)
```
<h1>User Info</h1>
 <label>E-mail</label>
 <input type="email" ng-model="user.email">
 <label>Last name</label>
 <input type="text" ng-model="user.lastName">
 <label>First name</label>
 <input type="text" ng-model="user.firstName">
 <label>Website</label>
 <input type="url" ng-model="user.website">
 <label>Description</label>
 <textarea ng-model="user.description"></textarea>
 <label>Password</label>
 <input type="password" ng-model="user.password">
 <label>Password (repeat)</label>
 <input type="password" ng-model="repeatPassword">
 <label>Roles</label>
 <label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" ng-model="user.admin">
Is Administrator</label>
 <pre ng-bind="user | json"></pre>

```

*** input directive

input w/ng-model supports additional functionality
/ binding to the model
/ all the basic input directives support required
functionality depends on input's type attribute
type="text" or textarea, accepts any string
/ change the text & the model instantly changes
/ allow you to specify minimum and maximum lengths
/ as well as arbitrary regular expressions (ex: http://plnkr.co/edit/nmbaFj?p=preview )

*** checkbox & radio inputs

checkbox
/ indicate a boolean input
// <input type="checkbox" ng-model="user.admin" />
/ can specify different strings for true and false
// <input type="checkbox" ng-model="user.role" ng-true-value="admin" ng-false-value="basic" />

radio
/ provides a fixed group for a field (ex: http://plnkr.co/edit/Nvu98h?p=preview )
(html)
```
<label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.sex"
value="male">Male</label>
<label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.sex"
value="female">Female</label>

```

*** select & ng-options inputs

select
/ allows you to create a drop-down list
/ specify statically or from an array on scope

(html)
```
<select ng-model="sex">
 <option value="m" ng-selected="sex=='m'">Male</option>
 <option value="f" ng-selected="sex=='f'">Female</option>
</select>
```

ng-options binds select to an object (ex: http://plnkr.co/edit/LQDmOP?p=preview )
/ accepts a comprehension expression of what is displayed
// [value as] label [group by grouping]
// for item in arrayExpression
// for (key, value) in objectExpression

*** single page application navigation

easy to read URLs structure apps for users
deep-linking URLs refer to a specific feature
/ can be emailed or messaged
back & forward buttons continue to work
uses HTML5 history API if available
services: $location, $anchorScroll
directive: ng-view

*** hashbang URLs (after the # character)

administration of users typical URLs:
/ /admin/users/list - this url shows a list of existing users
/ /admin/users/new - this url shows a form to add a new user
/ /admin/users/[userId] - this url shows a form to edit an existing user with ID equal to [userId]
SPAs translate these partial URLs to full URLs
/ http://myhost.com/#/admin/users/list
/ http://myhost.com/#/admin/users/new
/ http://myhost.com/#/admin/users/[userId]
allows us to change URLs without reloading
/ history works
/ won't issue calls to server

*** history API in html5

hashbang trick makes URL long & ugly
history API can simulate external resources
/ without actually making round trips to the server
history.pushState can change URL history
window.onpopstate can observe history changes
allows use of pretty URLs (without #)
/ http://myhost.com/admin/users/list
/ http://myhost.com/admin/users/new
/ http://myhost.com/admin/users/[userId]
looks standard, but if typed in, will issue a request to the server

*** $location service

masks the differeance between hashbang and HTML5 URL
/ consistent API regardless of browser mode
api to get/set part of the current URL
/ protocol, host, port, path, query params, etc.
allows us to observe changes & take action
intercepts user's interaction with links

*** $location API
http://myhost.com/myapp/admin/users/list?active=true#bottom
or in hashbang mode
http://myhost.com/myapp#/admin/users/list?active=true#bottom
me

method : would return
$location.url() : /admin/users/list?active=true#bottom
$location.path() : /admin/users/list
$location.search() : {active: true}
$location.hash() : Bottom

*** $routeProvider example

(html)
```
<body ng-controller="MainCtrl">
 <script type="text/ng-template" id="
embedded.home.html">
 <h1> Home {{name}}</h1>
 </script>

 <script type="text/ng-template" id="
embedded.about.html">
 <h1> About {{name}}</h1>
 </script>

 <div>
 <div id="navigation">
 <a href="#/home">Home</a>
 <a href="#/about">About</a>
 </div>
 <div ng-view></div>
 </div>
</body>
```

(js)
```
app.controller('MainCtrl', function() {})
.config(function ($routeProvider) {
 $routeProvider.
 when('/home', {
 templateUrl: 'embedded.home.html',
 controller: 'HomeController'
 })
 .when('/about', {
 templateUrl: 'embedded.about.html',
 controller: 'AboutController'
 })
 .otherwise({
 redirectTo: '/home'
 });
});
```
