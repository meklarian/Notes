as much as 90% of this value is coming from non-owned accounts

Q: how is MVP calculated?
A: we have two values, MVP (EV) in $, equivalent to what a commercial would cost
on social media, we calculate what it would cost to buy an equivalent ad (twitter sponsored tweet, IG ad, FB ad)

Q: how do you charge?
A: on a subscription basis. for sports teams, they pay for a season typically.

Q: do you only do analysis, or do you also setup marketing plans
A: we do both, but usually focus on analysis first. often they need to learn how to digest the massive quantity of info first and build out a strategy/adapt. (paraphrased - ed)

Q (by me): do you do facial recognition?
A: we do facial feature recognition, like snapchat filter (primitive), robust db of celebrities and people, can identify common celebrities like leonardo dicaprio, selena gomez, etc.
