was surprised how welcoming everyone is
one of the things that has changed - amount of resources available on the internet
thank you to everyone who has contributed answers to stack overflow, unity forums, etc.
please continue to do this, while you may not read all the thank yous, it's all still relevant

VR shows promise for the future
we can use this to virtually free people who are bedridden / handicapped (elderly, etc)
we can use this to teach kids
