talking about scripting
differences between games and apps

app ui loop
app waits for events

while(true) { awaitMessage(); dispatchMessage(); } // paraphrased - ED

game always runs

while(true) { processInput(); update(); render(); }

most game engines are in C/C++ for performance
you need performance to be able to make games run well

slide: Game Engines in C/C++ "performance, fps, ugh pointers, latency"
almost all of this is written by programmers / developers

slide: Game Content Is: "active story, sound, interactions, writing, mechanics"
all of these things are written by designers and not programmers

slide: designers create with code, CODE IS DATA "preventing crashes, saving game state, fast iteration"

slide: different types of language "data definition languages, runtime languages"

slide: runtime languages "transpiling, compiling to native code, VMs"

slide: the borders get blurred, CODE IS DATA

example: http://www.puzzlescript.net/

another example: naughty dog
makers of uncharted
background in lisp
scheme-like language with lambdas and continuations
VM hosted by the engine

slide: constraints breed creativity "experimentation is key, fast iteration times, ..."

slide: component based programming

demo: games in Unity
