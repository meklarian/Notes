eric fischer - teaching programming (and other technical subjects)

there's always someone who might want to learn

one key thing about programming and other technical skill

you need motivation

money
a reward
a risk of punishment
a feeling of accomplishment
recognition
etc.

punishment is not a good motivator

money is similarly bad, one time motivator

but if you enjoy learning, intrinsically you are likely to continue
and to continue enjoying feeling of accompishment / recognition, etc

i'll teach them the same way i learned!

this is not always the right away

for me, it looked like this (slide: classroom)

more accurately, like this (slide: asleep classroom)

get to accomplishing something ASAP
the faster you actually get some reward or feedback of completion, the better

everyone's mind works a little differently

find multiple ways to relate (paraphrased - ED)

if your learner looks like this, you need to explain it differently
(slide: bored/confused child)

"stuck" is the worst state a learner can be in, and quickly saps motivation

toxic: we'll do it right from the start!
you start wanting to teach MVC actions

think of learning like eating
keep things bite-sized, one thing at a time
give time to process (repeat, practice, etc)
don't give them too much
and you can only do so much before you need a break

never ever ever ever say:
you just don't get it
you can't
you won't
you failed
you're wrong
