UI/API -> transactions -> Read Models

why do we complicate this so much?
people complain that we have insufficient scale or handling

is there a good hello world for microservices?

simplicity is synchronicity
take away async

command is executed
event is stored
event is published
read models updated
new information is shown
etc.

show that state transition is quickly satisfied

go + git as a teaching tool

go
built in web server
runs anywhere

git repo
store each success cycle in a commit capturing skills
event streams
projections
merge conflict resolutions

F# or C# or BASH??

collaborate using your favourite language
keep it simple
don't get tempted by shiny frameworks, libraries
