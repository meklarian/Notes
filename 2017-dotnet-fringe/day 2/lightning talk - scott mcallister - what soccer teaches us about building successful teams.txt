scott mcallister - what soccer teaches us about building successful teams

on sports
successes and failures are self evident

core elements of successful teams

goals
objectives agreed upon by everyone

roles
clearly define who will have what roles

norms
rules of conduct in a group

rl example: real salt lake

2006 - struggling 2nd year startup
top goal scorer
last place in standings

2007 - norms
do they fight?
do they work hard?
are they willing to learn?

another example: portland timbers
similar attributes

2015 - norm: everyone defends
a culture based on this principle

how are our project teams?
are our goals understood by all team members?
are our roles clearly defined and clearly communicated?
what are our cultural norms?
