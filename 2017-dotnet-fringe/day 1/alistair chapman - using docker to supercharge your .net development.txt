Docker + .NET Core + Linux

intro
building with docker
building for docker
being a magpie developer 101

a note on moving targets

moby supersets docker
1.1 to 2.0 preview on .net core

docker
--
process and env isolation
supported on linux, windows, and macOS
currently undegoing a minor identity crisis

.NET core
--
the next generation of the .net platform
supported on windows, macOS, linux
currently undergoing a minor identity crisis
(primarily on ubuntu and centOS, will get better in 2.0)

.NET core on linux

demo: basic app on linux, hello world .cs file and .csproj

adding docker to the mix

use a dockerfile to build an image
then run your image to run your app in a container
your base image decides the environment

demo: executing .net app without .net installed, just build against OS target

building with docker
--
using containers for .net builds and continuous integration

docker containers provide:
isolation
clean environments
deterministic builds

containers won't provide:
real world usage
security for untrusted code
compatibility guarantees

building for docker
--
building cloud-native apps in containers
building knowing you want to target a docker environment
(doing what the other cool kids are doing)

requires a new approach to architecture

loose coupling
isolation
etc.

where to next?

try it yourself
check out windows containers
develop futher with schedulers
host on your platform of choice
kubernetes
