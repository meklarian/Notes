on hero worship: the one thing that is consistent is that no matter where he worked (retrospective), his peers, so-called everyday developers, helped build his skills and career the most.

they were all teachers and mentors above and beyond their everyday jobs

from Jim: best known for being the author of Ruby Koans, a resource for learning Ruby

-- .NET Core Koans

Why .NET Core Koans?

One of the barriers to entry to developing in .NET (ed: and MS stack) is the amount of stuff needed to get started, such as visual studio, sql server, etc.
