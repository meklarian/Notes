embeddinator-4000 james montemagno

can put .net everywhere
iOS, android, etc.

what if you're a developer writing objc, java, swift, C++

how could you reuse all the .net greatness there
all those amazing libraries
do you give up your nuget addiction?
etc.

the embeddinator: turns any .net library into a native library

demo: mac app, iOS app consuming .net library packaged from embeddinator 4000
