Where to start?

Handbook to Neuroevolution through Erlang by Gene Sher (explores DXNN systems)
F# Prototype - Neural fish (github.com/JeremyBellows/NeuralFish)
Rebuilt in Elixir - Evolixir (github.com/JeremyBellows/evolixir)

the neuron
has inbound connections
barrier, when full, calculates output synapse
sends signal to outbound connections

inbound weighted synapse = raw inbound synapse value * neural connection weight

this is the basis for learning

-- the sensor

sensors have one job: synchronize
pulls in data and pushes out into the network

vector of data, send to neurons

[5, 2, 8] -> 5 >> A; 2 >> B; 8 >> C (strongly ordered)

A barrier takes its inputs, sums them, when full, calls an activation function, outputs connections

the actuator: function flow

has a barrier, receives synapses from neurons, passes signal when full to an action function

-- neural networks
sensors -> neural layer 1 -> neural layer 2 -> actuators

most neural networks are recursive

sensors -> [neural layer 1 <-> neural layer 2 <-> ... neural layer N] -> actuators

---- evolution

topology mutations
add neuron
add neuron outsplice
add neuron insplice
add outbound connection
add inbound connection
add sensor
add actuator
add sensor link
???
mutate activation function
mutate weights
??? (invert?) weights

mutation: add neuron
randomly selects a neuron to add a new neuron, adds connections in/out

mutaion: add sensor
add a sensor and attach its outputs into the graph, potentially introduced into the same paths as existing sensors

-- life simulation

basic artificial life simulation rules

entities must have a finite lifespan
entities have an energy cost for actions and time progression
food is available

exactly the right amount of food needs to be available
enough for competition for food, not too much that everyone is satisfied and competiion ends
