Crashlytics & Answers
using fabric on a mobile dev flow

some background
#1 - never break user expectations

current mobile dev landscape
- agile methodology
- SDK bloat
- importance of user engagement for app success

hard to find SDKs that are lightweight and easy to integrate
apps are so hard for users to download
- conversion points
- many links/navigation steps to app
- often skip reading the description
- sometimes browse video/screenshot
- looks at ratings
- most people will 1-star an app if it crashes

perf metrics
we use crashlytics to help us pinpoint one of our major performance metrics, Crash Rate, as we aim to keep it very low.
Crash Rate < 1%
when the crash rate exceeds 1% they hustle to bring it back down

adding crashlytics to dev flow
2 week sprint
feature releases = 2-3 sprints
point release = 1 minor release = 1 sprint

after a feature release
plan 2-3 point releases
first point release = crashlytics release

slide: showing crashlytics dashboard showing before release issue, notes 3 crashes were QA team having discovered a crash

dealing with crashes

the same crash often affects more users on the subsequent release, if not fixed
can QA repro it?
- device type & orientation: ipad, iphone
- operating systems: OS version
- stacktrace

YES: add scope to sprint
NO: hope for the best

slide: darth vader - "i have altered the product scope, pray i don't alter it further"

answers metrics
answers gives us real-time statistics so we can evaluate how our app is being used
- active user numbers
- session length
- stability rating
- retention
