what is deep linking?
ex: http://www.colehaan.com/pinch-campus-penny-loafer-sequoia-ivory
links to a pair of shoes

counterex: http://www.colehaan.com
not a deep link, goes to home page

mobile deep linking is broken
your web link is dropping high quality traffic
people arrive at the mobile web, but these people will convert better if they buy in your app

the problem and solution

native apps are cut off from the world

[email marketing, social media, paid search, content shares] -> mobile web || native app

branch: contextual mobile deep linking
make links to content in your app work just like links to content on the web
deep links all have something in common: when you click, the next thing you see is what you clicked on

deep linking is the missing puzzle piece
mobile deep linking gives you back all the tools and techniques you've always used

brands that implement contextual mobile deep linking see huge benefits
jet: 3X user downloads, 150% traffic
etc.

results with deep links:
+180% signups
+200% engagement
+190% retention
(global to branch)

how deeplinks work

on mobile
link click -> app installed? -> app content ; not installed -> app store

on the web
link click -> phone# -> text link to phone -> enter mobile flow

features:
smart banner
seamlessly convert users from mobile web to app
3X daily downloads

deepviews
show your users app content before install
6X click to install rate (used by cookpad, dojo)
slide: shows preview page generated by branch
