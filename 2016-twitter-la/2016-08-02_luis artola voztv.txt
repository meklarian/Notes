Fabric for Content Apps

slide: jerry maguire

two paths for software:
- living and existing
- fading out into obscurity / dying

initially released an app on parse / facebook, only to have the plug pulled on parse the day after first approval in the app store

3 key pieces needed in their app
- push notifications
- analytics
- ???

not having analytics is like driving a car without a dashboard, or a plane without instrumentation. you could do it, but it's not the best experience.

things needed from analytics for their app
- are people consuming content
- are they sharing content
- what sports are they interested in

after presentation in january (twitter Hello World presentation in Santa Monica), decided to give Fabric a shot. was initially going to build all the pieces in-house.

used answers to instrument metadata for sports media (video) shown in the app

slide: graphs from Answers dashboard, showing histograms and graphs of user engagement
slides: breakouts of trends and user events by sport, etc., including projections

backend uses sentry for monitoring
sentry is a service to log errors, includes dashboard to show what's happening, can be attached to slack
crashlytics is like sentry, but for mobile

slide: showing crashlytics crash report (ed: speaker notes 0 crashes in the last two months)

fabric has been a good solution for voztv
easy to integrate
solved problems in building the app
simple api to use

originally integrated branch before fabric, but might go all-fabric

ed: speaker believes fabric is future-proof, given that twitter is committed to supporting it 
ed: used branch for deep-linking
