developing for the rest of the world

how do you reach every person on this planet?

background: world on twitterkit, twitter, and digits

twitter's localization issues: 34 languages in 40 locales

agenda:
* localization
* RTL
* testing
* payments
* performance matters

-- Localization
not everyone speaks english

how do you get started?
what are the steps to go from english to all markets?

identify your target audience
* market size and opportunity
* competitive landscape
* local pricing and financial factors

click through rates are higher in the us than in other locales

US Audience
37.5M Spanish Speakers
2.8M Chinese (Catonese & Mandarin speakers)
2.1 Trillion spending by Hispanic and Asian households combined

Brazil Audience
205M Population
82% are smartphone users
8th largest economy in the world

-- String Localization

move all strings into strings.xml
provide sufficient context for declared strings
mark message parts that should not be translated

in android, you can get string literal warnings on localization traps

provide context for declared strings

-- beware of special words: is the meaning ambiguous?

example: demonstration
a. an exhibition of how something works or should be performed
b. a public meeting or march protesting against something

-- provide limits for translators

where is the string displayed?
* app launcher
* button
* label
* panel
* title
* etc.

what are the layout constraints?
buttons are usually more space constrained
30 char limit for some apps, less on other platforms

-- strings that should not be translated
brand names
certain proper names
placeholders
special unicode chars (Emoji)
urls
code

-- localizing data
what about dates, currency, numbers (decimals), phone numbers, and units of measure?

many developers use features built on top of IBM's ICU libraries

also, system provided formats: dates, decimals, strings, etc.

note on strings, some systems use special comparers, some use collations.
in english, one area of concern:
A, a have secondary differences and often may be sorted together
A, B have primary differences and should never be sorted together

for units of measure, only 3 countries are officially imperial: United States, Myanmar, Liberia

-- RTL
audience - arabic speakers
160M users
80% phones shipped with android in the middle east
0.8% web content in arabic

RTL support
4.0
arabic fonts (2.3 gingerbread)
arabic localized
arabic reshaper
(what's an arabic reshaper?
arabic is a cursive language, so if you were to try and read it as a native reader with spaces, it would be slow to read. A reshaper adjusts words to be in cursive for a more natural experience.
available since iOS 3

4.1 android
bidi support for textview and edittext
4.2 android
rtl layout mirroring
improved fonts for intl. users
4.3 android
improved bidi support to handle mixed direction text

demo: bidi support as tweet

RTL mirroring
automatic mirroring of layouts so that layouts are reversed right to left from left to right

ViewPager
no support for RTL
ong standing request for support by community
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=56831

drawable mirroring
mirroring your image assets

-- Forced RTL layout

easier to debug RTL layout issues without switching to RTL language

-- RTL Support

script types
english and english-like (latin, greek, and cyrillic)
dens (chinese, japanese, and korean)
tall (south & SE asian and middle eastern languages)

material design
english: regular 14sp
dense: regular 15sp
tall: regular 15sp
(guidelines from google material design)

---- Testing Localization

setup a test environment
look for common localization issues
review with native-language speakers

-- common issues
clipped text or text that overlaps the edge of the ui elements or screen
bad line breaks

fastlane
screengrab - generate localized screenshots of your android app
supply - upload screenshots, metadata and your app to the play store

-- payments
credit card penetration is extremely high in the US

Ex: Middle East
only 2% credit cards
82% do not have bank accounts
5% paypal market share in the middle east


Payment Gateways
Paypal
availabe in all countries
limited penetration
usually linked to credit card or bank account

Stripe
not available in Middle East

Carrier Billing
billed to wireless account
carrier charges a processing fee
typically only used for digital goods

Prepaid
popular for young adults and those without credit
value can be added at retail locations
usually a fee associated with adding value to card or processing payment

Tpay.me
direct carrier billing provider
charged to phone bill

Cash U
prepad card accepted by online retailers
available in the middle east in north africa
users load cards at POSs

-- Performance Matters
WebP/PJPEG Case Study

We had an initiative at twitter to try and be the fastest app everywhere

Audience: India
300M wireless subscribers
only 1M on 4G+
800MB avg data used by 3G subs in a month

WebP

built by google
lossy and lossless image compression developed by google
open source, BSD licensed
native support on android 4.0+
28% reduction in size compared to pngs recompressed with pngcrush

PJPEG
progressive jpeg

image is compressed in multiple passes of progressively higher detail
no transparency support
no native support on android

Fresco
image loading and display library from fresco
support for PJPEG out of the box
no feature gaps
caching
progress bars
scaling
resize and rotation

Results - WebP
images were 25% smaller compared to PNG or JPEG images
increased user engagement, esp. in emerging markets

Results - PJPEG
25% decrease in image size vs jpeg or png
9% decrease in p50 load times
74% decrease in failures

User Empathy
2G Day
throttled all employee accounts
iOS and Android only
didn't simulate network error rates

Cost Notification
currently iOS only
provides employee with region specific costs for network usage
