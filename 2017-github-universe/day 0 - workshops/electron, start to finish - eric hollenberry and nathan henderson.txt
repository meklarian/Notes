** agenda

double-check those prerequisites
what is electron?
hands on - let's build some apps!
better than hello world
electron weather

** repositories

ref: https://github.com/universeworkshops/electron-weather
ref: https://github.com/universeworkshops/electron-codepen

https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/issues/127

** examples of apps published by other people
https://electron.atom.io/apps/

** background: reciting information on the state of javascript, chrome, v8 js engine, node, npm, etc.

slide: atom (history at github)
under the hood, uses node.js

slide: electron
framework initially used to build atom
extracted out

electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with js, html, and css

** how does electron work?

two processes: main process, renderer process
main process: application lifecycle
renderer process: web page

main process:
browser-window
ipc
node.js
menu & dialog

renderer process:
ipc
DOM
remote
node.js

ownership graph:
main process (1) -> renderer processes (1..N)

** example: github desktop application
is an electron application

ref: https://githubengineering.com/how-four-native-developers-wrote-an-electron-app/

mention: coffeescript, typescript

** let's build!

first exercise: electron codepen

ed - got project working, takes a while to setup via instructions on a slow connection
ed - ref: https://github.com/universeworkshops/electron-codepen#how-to-use

ed - diversion: https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-desktop-applications-with-angularjs-and-github-electron
ed - curious about whether anyone has had any success using angular in electron

second exercise: electron weather

ed - got project working, at various stages in the exercise, the window may not appear properly in place on windows. after the menubar installation to replace all the existing initialization code with menubar, the window displays correctly relative to the windows bar. on the presenter's laptop, the app works correctly out of the box because in macOS (darwin+), the menu bar is at the top and intialization code is working off of the correct assumptions.
