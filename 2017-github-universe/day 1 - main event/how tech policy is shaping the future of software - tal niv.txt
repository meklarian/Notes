tough questions about policy and legal matters come up all the time

caption: tech policy
shaping the future of software

policies are present for their ??? value
technology challenges existing ??? institutions and causes change

example: one policy that has led to good outcomes for us is net neutrality

what we are seeing now is the sequel to the net neutrality debase
earlier this year the FCC showed its intent to reclaim (strike?) this order

crowd survey: who is aware of this reversal in policy? who is aware of the impact? who has contributed to fighting for open internet.

the EU is voting on copyright review
article XIII of the EU copyright directive
platforms that provide open access to code
must gate and filter access to code
as a result, all users will have their code restricted and may be abused by content publishers
if implemented, would prevent devs from using specific software and tools

*** policy & universe talks

(ed note: speaker is speaking too fast and has few slides)

policy has influenced the entire lineup of talks at universe

ex. regulated industries, limitless possibilities: how capital one, box, deutsche borse, and accenture federal services stay compliant and innovative

ex. balancing identity & privacy: building tools to help users

ex. algorithmic biases in AI and ML

ex. no excuses: if government can open source, so can you

*** why it matters

** impacts developer work and outcomes
barriers/cost of entry
worker/entrepreneur mobility
ability to learn, transfoer skills
innovation, interesting work
extortion/blocking, risk level
industry reputation/contribution
vs.
IP
censorship
employment
privacy
surveillance
research

** github policy - collective action & representation

...

* policy as a service
aiming towards policy optimization in three distinct ways

- impacting laws and regulation
- listening, researching, analyzing, explaining
- driving new standards, modeling best practices

we make a genuine effort to drive (... the best standards)

* public and private regulation interplay
- industry self regulation: transparency & substance
- reduce need for aggressive an dpossibly bad public regulation
- light path for further self regulation innovation & increase probability of good public regulation

*** open sourcing policies
site policy: BEIPA

balanced employee IP agreement

github/site-policy
github/balanced-employee-ip-agreement

** site-policy
21 site policies open sourced
open licensed + public repo
issues, pull requests, feedback and release cycle
substantial community engagement

** site-policy benefits
open and continuous iteration
transparency + trust + legitimacy
knowledge diffusion on policies needed, good approaches

** balanced-employee-IP-agreement, BEIPA
open source IP agreement used at github
recognizes employee's IP rights in work unrelated to business
impacts mobility

** BEIPA benefits
acknowledges how developers actually work, minimizes creative friction
promotes innovation, creativity, mobility
all time #1 HN story about github is the BEIPA launch

** let's get to work
policy@github.com

q: are there tools devs can build to make this all easier?
a: definitely (?? nonanswer?)

q: how do you distinguish between users who do part and part, how do you tell what is user IP and company IP?
a: i encourage you to look at our policy repos so you can see how we solved this, and see if you think our solution makes sense

q: do you have anything for law firms, basically anyone who has to work in private, any of the tools that you used to collaborate internally? do you have a place where you talk about your internal legal tooling?
a: tomorrow we have a talk about the legal team's use of github, and it will talk about how we use github for our internal legal needs. certainly there are use cases that require private repos for offline work. law firms are a different story, of course, there are reasons for them to keep things in private, never public. but tomorrow's presentation will touch upon this.
