intro
merritt intro
background, joined github's legal team
was pregnant when she started @ github
left behind kaiser permanente
to join github
what she did understand about github
github embraces, even encourages the whimsical and delightful
despite experiencing imposter syndrome at the time
happy to have joined and come to the realization that she (could succeed here? - missed phrase - ed)

** out goal
goal at github
is to empower and help developers to grow
we want github to be the platform where you can build, learn, create, explore, and grow
we take great pride in our platform and recog. that we are in an incredibly (powerful?) position to help developers to grow

to be this leader
we need to be the best, most inclusive, most diverse workplace in the industry as well
we believe in the diversity and identity not only make us (missed phrase - ed)

we're empowering employees to create, tinker, and bring (??? - ed) to the platform

we went out and created a new function
it is called employee experience and engagement

slide: EEE exists to improve the employee experience for people from all backgruond and amplify our commitment to diversity inclusion and bellonging while bringing deeper value drive meaning and purpose to working at github

there is nothing that i want more than for every employee to wake up, whether morning or night, and to be able to contribute their best.

say hello to the EEE organization
it is an intentional coming together of established teams
learning, dev, and workplace operations
with newly formed teams
experience, advocacy, and inclusion/belonging
it is brought into one umblreaa to intensify our commitment to the employee (teams? -ed)

we partnered with everrise to provide metorship opportunites inside and outside of github
and are grateful to have a learning portal for curated resources (and etc.)

from the minute one decides to beomce  a hubber, we want those inspirational pillars of support to build them up to be able to do the best work of their lives
whether new or established employees
we always want them to end every day knowing they made a 100% best decision to become a githubber

whether it is shipping a big project or welcoming a new octakitten to the family...

the experience team hanresses its passion for our employee into creating experiences in programs that recog empathize, support and celebrate all of us
in doing this we are far bigger than ourselves, far more than our individual selves, etc.
excited to see what this will bring us

mentioning spaces in various offices and also supporting remote workers

we have gender inclusive bathrooms
dedicated spaces to forster organic connections and conversation

we also know a bit about the ppace of growth at startups
and the burnout that is so real for many
with these things in mind
we designed and constructed a prayer and meditation room for peace and quiet (etc.)
in these spaces we hope that hubbers can think, refresh, and go back to their big ideas.

(interactive question line demonstrating the value of employee advocacy)

the employee experience is multilayered
complex and very dynamic
as an advocate, she is one of teh many layers
an additional channel and open space for feedback
and complementary to colleagues in HR
hubbers have a sounding board and thought partner to ensure they are heard, engaged, and aligned with decisionmaking at the company and aligned with values and objectives
this funciton is a work in progress, we are shaping it as the needs of employees arise
it is critical to our success because it embodies and amplifies the voice of our people
the people that work daily to build an construct an inclusive github experience

** diversity, inclusion, belonging

we believe and have seen that when people can show up
bring their whole self to work
and do their best work
we all benefit
we integrate inclusion and belonging into how we work together
how we build ourp roduct
and how we grow our communities

real talk, tho: we don't always get it right
we don't have it all figured out
we want to do it well
and it is that comitment to it
knowing that we all come to this from different places
...
being able to have conversations to improve

in the spirit of github is to make good on the promise
the promise of diversity and inclusion
the spirit of belonging at github (paraphrase? - ed)

we can set the universal standard for the industry
all together
let's go together
make sure everyone is included in the conversation
etc.

blacktocats
employee resource group

blacktocats attract and empower black lives in tech

* the start
before they existed
github published its first ever diversity report
in that report
only 2 percent identified as black or african american
shortly after that
we decided that we are more than just black employees
and with the support of leadership  and others
in 2017, since then, github has doubled its percentage from 2 to 4%

* our mission
attract the best black talent
promote black career development at github
facilitate the black tech community's participation in softare development
connect internal and external communities with blacktocat initiatives

26 members strong
10 different states
and 2 international blacktocats
last night, we got to come together
at HQ, we got together with some of our black contemporaries
we heard from tony with gv
about what he is investing in outside of tech
and we heard a panel on pressing issues of today
etc.
the blacktocats are extremely geographically diverse
but we are also sovling a incredibly diverse class of problems at github
we are product managers
building world class dev tools
layers defending oss policy
and leaders in ensuring all of the ways it transcends code

* initiaed the blacktocats charter
define a roadmap
had a mini meetup in miami
had the privilege to server breakfast at the chapman center, serving homeless in miami

partnereed with greater than, providing software dev and IT skills to previously incarcerated citizens
did a half day workshop in baltimore to train and inform people on the basics such as code and text editors

we will be hosting black tech events
focused primarily on black engineers
we'll be at career fairs
working with the EEE team at github to work on an inclusive pipeline at github

**** 
community and safety
danielle leong
application engineer

works on community and safety team
caption: diversity and inclusion needs to be more than a buzzword

but unfortunately, these words have become buzzwords
it is important for people not only at github
but everyone that uses github as a platform
it needs to be more than reports and graphs
needs to be more than a survey we send out
it needs to be more than all this
inclusion and user safety needs to be built into the product itself

** inclusion and user safety need to be built into the product itself

** biases in products make life miserable for marginalized people

caption: it's not enough to assume people will be nice

we all know that in today's world, on the net, toxic communities exist
in offoline communities, such as a conference
we have social norms and mods to ensure people are on their best behavior
if i ere to punch someone in the face
i would get ejected
probably fired
and be made an example on the net for this 

caption: 79% of americans believe online platforms have a responsibility to take care of harassment

caption: platforms need to build moderation and safety features

captions:
women are more than twice as likely to have their pull requests merged if they hide their gender
46% of black people experience harrassment on a regular bases
women experience twice as many death and rape threats as men

build systems that empower inclusive and healthy communities and encourage good online citizenship
discourage behavior that is destructive or threatens personal safety

*** tiered moderation tools
one example: the banhammer
but the problem with it, it's not nuanced enough
what if we missed acontext
so we wanted to make it so that we can handle a multitude of possible interactions

slide: temporary interaction limits

** easier to grow communities

OSS is fantastic
but it is really scary to get started
so we introduced first time contrib badges
to help welcome new people into the community

also want to make it as easy as possible to add a COC to your project

*** user safety

example: atom repo, blocked user badge
shows when someone you have blocked has contributed to a project

build consensual software that asks for permission
not for forgiveness

want to make sure you are aware of what kind of data we have on you, and also that you want to interact with this (sic, slide) feature

cpation: communities on github and safe and inclusive, composed of diverse users acting as model online citizens

but we can't do it alone

employee experience and ERGs help hubbers grow and be their authentic self to build the best product for you

we are here to put in the hard work to make that happen
not here to just throw buzzwords and graphs and numbers
we're here to do the hard work to provide the best experience possible

*** thakn you
