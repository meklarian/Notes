big data day la
real-time analytics in transactional applications
brian bulkowski, CTO and Founder, Aerospike

what is aerospike?
large-scale dHT database O(1) get/put

high availability clusterin & rebalancing
hybrid memory - provides either persistent DRAM or Flash
KVS++ provides query, predicate filters, table/columns, aggregations
cloud-saavy, etc.

* traditional architecture has significant limitations

Challenges
- complex
- maintainability
- durability
- consistency
- scalability
- cost ($)
- data lag

mysql is 5-10k tx/s consistent worst case (100% cache miss) (ed- by what measure?)

concept: hybrid memory database, powered by high performance noSQL

bottleneck: many websites take 50-100 internal requests to satisfy one web request

* non-relational real-time

500 business tx/s x 5000 calculations per business tx = 2.5M DB tx / sec

actual activity: credit card processing -> 5k business tx/s

* to summarize
(presenter has a weird slide with a mish-mash of... stuff)

* keys to success
use application frameworks, and write code
- allow multiple examples

...

* adtech - real-tiome advertisement optimization
challenge
- rapid customer algorithm deployment
- low read latency (ms)
- scale from 100k to 5m operations/s
- ensure 100% uptime with global data

performance requirement
- 1-6B cookies tracked
- 5.0 auctions/s
- 100m ad rendering. 50ms real-time bidding, 1ms db access
- 1.5kb median object size

selected nosql
- flash economics
- faster algo development
- easy partner onboarding

diagram: stack
web request <-> publishers <-> ad networks & ssps <-> ad exchanges, data management platforms
ad exchanges <-> demand side platform -> data management platforms
demand side platform <-> brands/agencies/buyers

* fraud prevention beyond the rules engine

challenge
- rapid customer algorithm deployment
- overall sla 750ms
- plan for 10x growth
- every payment transaction requires 100s of DB r/w

need to scale reliably
10-> 100TB
10B -> 100B objects
200k -> 1M+ TPS

selected noSQL
- flash economics with dram performance
cross data center (XDR) support

invert pattern of detection for card-not-present fraud detection
maintain records by IP, not by rule

* retail trading

challenge
- realtime exchange monitoring
- per-account risk calculation
- global risk calculation
- in-flight trade analysis
- memcache + db/2 has data inconsistency

need to scale reliably
3->13TB
100->400M objects
200k -> 1M TPS

selected NoSQL
built for flash
predictable low latency at high throughput
immediate consistency, no data loss
cross data center (XDR) support

* machine learning - data and model storage (online learning example)

unique user data store
53 servers across 4 DCs
specs:
512gb
cpu: e5-2620v2
disk: intel s3710 (13-15x 1.2TB SSDs)
aggregated 10gb NICs
2-namespaces

online learning (models store)
9 servers across 3 DCs
specs:
32gb ram
e5-2620 dual socket
disk: 1-240gb SSDs
network: aggregated 1gb NICs
1-namespace

* similar use cases
risk recalculation in minutes, not hours
immediate post-trade analytics
internet cache replacement / session management
telecom integrated real-time billing and routing
 account status determines routing, traffic shaping
retail predictive analytics
gaming and gambling
social messaging

* to summarize
focus on more KVP lookup patterns
stateless components as much as possible

* questions?

Q: what are some databases that work in this system?
A: databases that work in this paradigm are based in KVP pattern
redis
cassandra - interesting because it can be column-store AND row-store
dynamoDB
google bigtable - note the concepts introduced in how to use bigtable. big tables! independent rows.
