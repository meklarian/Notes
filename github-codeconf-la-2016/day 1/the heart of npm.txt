slide: "soft skills"
it's easy to dismiss communication as being a soft skill
but it's not easy, it can take effort to get points across in a meaningful and useful way

slide: strategies
flex your empathy
when in doubt, use emoji
(pt 2)
don't take it personally
the issue is rarely about you
(pt 3)
get comfy with conflict
don't feed the frustration
you (blaming) them = conflict
(pt 4)
ask questions
don't assume you know what's going on
(pt 5)
take breaks & slow down
"that's really interesting, I'll get back to you with more info asap"
  - most people just want to know that they're heard (being heard)
(pt 6)
apologize
* genuinely, without expectation

slide: communication = connection = community

slide: support your support team

slide: takeaways

npm loves you
adapt your communication
love your support team
