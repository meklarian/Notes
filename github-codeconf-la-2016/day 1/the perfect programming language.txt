the perfect programming language
michael bernstein, code climate

the story
----
speaker found a box of records containing a notebook, with records.
the notebook was titled: the perfect programming language, j. piano

the notebook was dedicated to borges, sun ra, and mccarthy (written in esperanto)

there was a record by sun ra, the heliocentric worlds of sun ra

jorge luis borges - the analytical language of john wilkins
john wilkins - toward a "universal language"

john mccarthy - father of lisp

entities
--
borges
sun ra
mccarthy
esperanto
programming languages

the language
--
semantics
type system
interfaces
distributed computing
gradual typing
data types
data structures
compiles to a small core language
portability
formally verifiable
syntax

why you shouldn't
--
it's not a real language
no notebook
no records
etc.
made up for the talk

the perfect programming language does not exist

constructed languages
--
esperanto, interlingua, lojban, etc.
there is a long history of people trying to make ideal languages

things that are often missing
--
friendly errors
editor integration
package management
libraries
existing programs and idioms
documentation
testing

the perfect programming language is the one you're using right now
languages don't succeed because they're perfect
languages succeed because of people
languages succeed because of the communities that we build and nourish
languages succeed because of the stuff we build
