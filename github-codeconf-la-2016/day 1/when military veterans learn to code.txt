slide (video):
documentary-like clip/interview on veteran
victor - marine corp veteran
served in iraq
deployed in iraqi freedom, enduring freedom
found it difficult to socialize back into society
found no programs to help transition
googled the top 100 jobs for 2015
first was dentist, number three was computer/software programming
(has always loved computers/computing)
code fellows is a seattle-based code school
the va only approves accreddited programs, which suppresses organizations from being able to reach out to veterans (paraphrased)
code school tuition room and board averages about $20,500
victor applied and was accepted
saved for 6 months to pay for the program

to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan - a. lincoln

mission: veteran-founded, and led, operation code is on a mission to get active military ... around the world to get to code

slide: map of US/europe and other worldwide presence

902 veterans served

177 marines
169 navy
16 coast guard
394 army

all branches represented
incl. national guard and reserve

the 1944 GI bill helped to train returning soldiers to train for the current work to create opportunities for them to not only go to college and get a job and get a home
currently this hasn't been updated since then
250,000 people currently don't get the opportunity or assistance after their service (paraphrased)


slide (video):
david molina presenting for operation code
operation code/founder
frustrated to find that the GI bill funds could not be used to train in learning to code
interviews with veterans who have served
the accredidation issue
interviews with other code school / resource CEOs/leaders
the VA has to keep up with the way the economy is working again
inherently they are bureaucratic and don't have the agility nor the focus to connect with people
government works slowly
eventually they will come around and see that a lot more is going on
and training is happening outside of 4 year universities
david: we're on a mission to create new opportunities for veterns in software development and coding
