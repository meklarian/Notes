hello web app
--
teaches programming for designers

how can i teach design to programmers?

slide: design: making an interface that works well

slide: picture of golden ratio (speaker notes this has nothing to do with real design)

slide: how can we create effective, basic designs

slide: let's talk clutter

fastest way for better looking designs: cut down on clutter

slide: the grid
line things up - pixel differences are definitely unconsciously noticed

slide: bootstrap
bootstrap is a good resource
comes with a grid

slide: color principles
keep your colors complimentary
use mostly neutrals + one brighter color for important bits

slide: colourlovers.com

slide: fonts
keep the number of fonts low - two different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb

use fancy/display fonts sparingly

vary weights (bold), style (italics), and transforms (uppercase, etc.) to differentiate bits

slide: resource -> beautiful web type -> http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type
slide: resource -> typewolf.com

slide: whitespace
the ultimate clutter reducer

examples: people who redesign hackernews
the new york times -> added more column spacing, other things

user experience principles
--
what's the most important action on your deisgn?
make it easy to find and use

pay attention to your goals
make them easy to find and use

content principles
--
less is more
big paragraphs are a sign of clutter
break into bullets if you can

people on the web don't read, they skim.

slide: shows breaking up paragraph into bullet list
then bullet list with bold lead-sentences
then bullet list with bold lead-sentences and extra line-spacing

headlines
--
talk benefits, not details
keep it short
use natural, friendly language

slide: good artists copy, great artists steal

slide: not sure if i'm a good developer // or good at googling (futurama fry gif)

slide: this is only the starting point!

summary
--
reduce visual clutter
keep the number of fonts and colors low
add white space
line things up
keep content short and easy to skim

make sure your goal is easy to find and use

keep your content simple, friendly, and to the point

practice, practice, practice
