slide: parse, the mobile backend as a service (mBaaS)
audience of mobile app devs

free backend
that can scale ($$$)

schema-less
security with ACL

slide: the client SDKs are the gateway to the service. the service has to be invisible

slide: timeline
started in august 2011 (open beta)
acquired by facebook in april 2013
mid 2015 - open source, client SDKs
open 2016 - intial notice of shutting down the project
early 2016 - parse server parse dashboard
january 2017 - end of service

slide: the open source family
iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS
browser, node, react-native
android
arduino, embedded C
.Net, Xamarin
PHP

Server + Dashboard

slide: to open source
from 1M users to 1

product shift: when it went open source, it just targeted 1 user

product shift -> technology shift -> audience shift

no longer a service, but a platform you run

ref: quote by drew gross

slide: parse-server, under the belly
express.js app
CLI interface
ES6
1000 tests, 8 environments
150mb RAM in sustained use

slide: parse-server
http://github.com/parseplatform/parse-server
10k git stars, 500 PRs, 1300 bugs, 2500 forks

slide: technology shift
formerly, 1 single point of contact
now: any platform (AWS, etc.)
problem with educating users to make choices on where to pick a host/backend for parse

slide: audience shift
from front-end to backend

front-end developers
- no backend skills
- many have never touched IaaS / PaaS
- many have never touched a database

slide: audience shift - open source is not easy
existing user concerns
- front-end -> continuity of service
- stability -> migrating to other providers

new user concerns:
- great api/sdk
- flexible solution
- ease of use

SaaS
- business
- making money

slide: moving forward, open source matters
extensible (parse-server-modules)
live queries
simple 'native' social authentication
postgres (cockroachDB)
CloudCode enhancements
