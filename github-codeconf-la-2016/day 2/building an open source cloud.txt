openstack
--
founded in 2010
OSS cloud, written in Python
Made up of 100s of projects
vast marketplace of supportive companies in the ecosystem
http://www.openstack.org/marketplace/

speaker background
--
author of common openstack deployments
senior automation & tools engineer at HPE
joined openstack infrastructure team in 2013

openstack deployments
--
familiar with various types of production openstack clouds
openstack infrastructure infra-cloud project
distilled and presented openstack basics using puppet
configuration management is super important to such a project

configuration management
--
installing openstack was hard
but today you don't need to get bogged down with basic config, you can leverage existing config management tooling (instead of mysql hacking)
and it's no longer proprietary and vendor specific

the usual suspects
--
puppet: puppet-nova
chef: cookbook-openstack-compute
ansible: openstack-ansible-os_nova
juju: charm-nova-compute

slide: let's be honest- installing openstack is still kind of hard

team expertise
--
strong linux systems engineers
network engineers
strong relationship with data center techs
python developers to assist with patches and relationship with upstream


what should your cloud do
--
just like any other cloud or virtualization environment
determine what you need and have preliminary plans for how you'll scale over time

compute power?
block storage?
object storage?
do you need speed? reliability?

networking
--
network planning is essential and difficult to change later
openstack networking with neutron is very flexible
local and public address planning and allocation

backups, recovery, fail-over
--
backup strategy
- what to back up
- location of backups (on/off-site)
fail-over
- "regions" across racks" datacenters?
- automatic/manual

doing more with open source
--
sure you could build customizations internally, but...
the openstack project runs an OSS infrastructure with a CI system and a large community for development of common solutions
(beware introducing technical debt for yourself)
(openstack requires 2 reviewers to review and approve changes)
