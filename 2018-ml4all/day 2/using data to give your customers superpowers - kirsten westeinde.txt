definitions
two types of machine learning problems
supervised & unsupervised

two types of supervised learning problems
classification & regression

if you can frame your problem as a classification or regression problem with consistent input features
it is a very good candidate to solve with machine learning

examples
--
order fraud detection
deciding eligibility for shopify capital cash advances
classifying merchants by industry

step 2: frame your problem as a machine learning model

an ML algo needs
prediction target
labelled data
features
acceptance criteria

models: linear regression, neural networks, random forest, support vector machines SVMs decision trees

step 4
productionize your model
