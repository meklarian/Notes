classification
identifies which category a new observation belongs
uses a training set of data container observations with known categories

diagram: puppies -> kittens -> raccoons -> baby raccoon

logistic regration
supervised classification algorithm
determines if observations belongs to some category: yes/no
for multiple categories, return yes/no for each category

diagram: logistic regression, showing partitions by category

training -> load data -> extract features -> train model -> evaluate
training -> load data -> extract features -> predict using model -> evaluate

indexer -> tokenizer -> stopwords remover -> TF-IDF (term frequency):(? document frequency) -> logistic regression -> index to string

collaborative filtering
learns without information about users or product attributes
learns by collecting interactions between users and products

ex. recommended restaurants near my location, recommend songs played by other users which played (bought) the same ones as me

collaborative filtering cannot be used for the first case (location is an invalid dimension on user), but can be used on the second
