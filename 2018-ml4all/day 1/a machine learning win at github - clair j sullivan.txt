*** github stats
67,000,000 repos
53,000,000 monthly users (MAU)
1,500,000,000 commits in the last year
0.5 petabytes of data

*** repository recommendations
mid october 2017 -> new tab: discover repositories

*** machine learning is a tool that should enable people
* do no harm
* do good
* make good

*** on recommendation engines
how do i find similarities such that i can recommend something that you would be interested in hearing about

*** making the sausage
github: we would like to put repos in front of people that might benefit from their involvement or might benefit the user

user page view activity -> find similar repositories -> repository scoring -> serve top N for each score

what data we use

the five key element
quality of the repo
repos you starred or watched
repos starred or watched by people you follow
repos that are trending
repos that are popular

>>> only for public repos and users that are not hidden. privacy matters!

quality of repository
use more than 30 metrics to evaluate this
weights for these were determined using random forest model

two most important are
does repository have a README (per speaker: even a blank one is a positive signal - ed)
how responsive is the repostitory?

12 metrics for responsiveness
median time from pr open to first review
median time from pr open to merge/close
median time from mopening an issue until receiving its first comment
median number of comments per issue
ratio of open:merged and open:closed PRs

repository size influences the result!

example 3rd party: GH Archive, makes data available

*** sample problem

SELECT repo name, type FROM [githubarchive:month.201712] WHERE actor.login = 'cj2001';

SELECT DISTINCT actor.login FROM [githubarchive:month.201712] WHERE repo.name = 'scipy/scipy' AND type = 'WatchEvent';

(112 new watches in Dec 2017)

SELECT DISTINCT repo.name, repo.id FROM `githubarchive.month.201712` WHERE actor.login IN (SELET actor.login FROM `githubarchive.month.201712` WHERE repo.name = 'scipy/scipy' AND type = 'WatchEvent') AND type = 'WatchEvent`)

*** could do a few things from here
* look for overlap from my watches and the other 111 other users
recommend things they are watching that i am not
* look at sequences -> those who watched scipy next watched _____?

*** general take aways (particularly for folks new to ML)
* before beginning, really ask yourself what is the goal of your model(s)
* 75% of being a data scientist is being a data janitor (doing things with NULLs, NaNs, etc)
* model at the end
* basic machine learning methods versus newer ones
