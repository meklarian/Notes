** obamacare
the landmark legislation that impacted the health insurance industry nationally

top 3 goals
make affordable health ins available to more people
expand the medicaid program to cover low income adults
support medical care delivery methods designed to lower costs

important provisions:
insurance mandates
employers w/50+ employees required to provide ins

anyone at 133% of poverty line eligible for medicaid
established the creation of healthcare exchanges in all 50 states
(or use the federally facilitated marketplace)

** the problem: churn

state run marketplaces lose 50% of consumers due to churn

people drop and qualify for medicaid
people end up qualifying for employer ins

* predicting churn can help plan for enrollment, ensure continuity of care, and reduce uninsurance
