whatcha up to?
- npm @3
- stabilizing work
- triaging, all the damn time
- product-related work

npm@3
- it's a year old now!
- works damn well now!
- ships by default with node@6!
- npm@2 around as LTS for a while

right now
- sustaining work
- stabilize test suite, make Travis/Appveyor reliable
- test suite passes on Windows (40% of userbase) (ed: wow!)
- big bugs
- npm shrinkwrap fixes
- moved to monthly release cycles
- reaching community? still trying things!

don't need cygwin or other exotic shells on windows
used to be on a semi-weekly release cycle
  prefer monthly to have more time to do work and coordinate

slide: despair (github tab: issues: 2,399 | pull requests: 84)

the cli team's state of triage
- we triage every damn day
- regularly go through feature requests and decide what to prioritize -- lots of them get closed
- bug bugs take priority over features
- @KenanY/@kyild added as contributorss!
- wanna help? Email forrest (don't actually email forrest) (definitely tweet at him)

product? but the cli is a product!
- npm cli team is FOSS-centered arm of npm, inc
- (minimzed, opt-in, anonymized) analytics!
- new login features! SSO! 2FA? (2FA/MFA for publishing!)
- future stuff? frontend-oriented features?
