slide: speaker sharing insight that she has a speech impediment, a stutter

a few fun (ed: !?) facts about stuttering

slide: picture of speaker at age when she started to stutter (ed: ~4?)

something like 85% of kids stutter between the ages of 3-5
some of it is kinetic
speaker's parents, siblings stuttered (brother?) but stopped stuttering by the time they were 10-12
unfortunately, (spoiler alert?), speaker is now 32 and has to deal with this every day
developed ways to cope with stuttering
would try to conceal it
would try to predict if there was a word she couldn't say fluently, she would switch it up before having to come up to it
spent a lot of time demoralized and angry, despised the way she sounded
came to a point where she decided she have to get some help
sought out speech therapy
her speech therapist told her that there is a conference for people who stutter
organized by an organization that's called: the national stuttering association
  because it has the interesting and confusing title of: NSA

slide: that's right, i'm in the NSA (same image, replaced head with unicorn)

was one of the first times she didn't feel ashamed about her impediment
and realized she also had to think about the other people who were there
and how to relate when they were communicating with her
that conference and experience and thinking about other people completely changed her view of communication

first thing we should know considering communication
  at it's core should be an act of great empathy

ed: missed excerpt

a problem with how you are presenting your thoughts
  it's completely self-focused
  see the way you approach conversation is all about you
  you want to see them love your thoughts the way that you do
    slide: kanye west - "my greatest pain in life is that i will never be able to see myself perform live"
this approach to conversation is a breeding ground for miscommunication
so, what do you need to do?

you have to think about the other person
you need to be a tad bit more empathetic

empathetic communication drives collaboration
when it comes to building companies and products and teams
collaboration is one of the most important things
we have a couple of problems
  collaboration is done almost entirely on the internet
    twitter, slack, etc.
  slide: microblogs are killing email: slack is the fastest growing B2B SaaS business, Snapchat, Twitter, Texting
so this is a truth we have to accept: technology cannot replace the social aspect of face-to-face communication
here's another truth: the consistent failures of communication cannot be automated away
  you must confront those failures eye-to-eye, not screen-to-screen
when you take away slack, twitter, cellphones, and computers
  you are left with a person
  so, when you deal with people, you have to talk to them
  people kind of hate talking to each other
  it's difficult to talk to people
  conversations where you have to talk about failure are incredibly hard conversations to have
because of these things
  collaboration is difficult
  and collaboration fails

collaboration fails because:
  people are afraid of being wrong
  people are afraid of being misunderstood

people are afraid of being wrong
--
the fear of being wrong is basically the fear of being judged
speaker mentions she personally has afraid of talking to people because she was afraid of being wrong, afraid of being judged
you know if you've ever been a conversation and chose to be silent because you were afraid of being wrong, it happens every day
so people are afraid people aren't going to totally get what they're trying to say
i completely understand this because it terrifies me to talk to people
and sometimes it takes two or three times to say what i need to say
and people don't always get what i'm trying to say
i can't tell you the number of times i've spoken to a developer, and he/she has been trying to tell me about a technical thing
 - and i'm not a technical person
and the conversation ends pretty abruptly becaues they have a hard time explaining, i have a hard time complaining, and they give up

it's hard to give up, but:
** Silence Kills Collaboration **

listening to what another person has to say doesn't take- your ideas aren't any less valuable or valid because you are being quiet while another person is talking about a thing that they would like to discuss
that actually enhances the conversation
when you are speaking
think about the listener
what do they need to hear you in order to really embrace the thing that you're trying to communicate to them
a thing to keep in mind here is that we're all on different planes intellectually and that's ok.
when you are listening to a speaker that is having a difficult time communicating
think about this day--
  -- i know that it's challenging what i'm trying to say
  you have to pay attention
  you have to focus
take that same approach when you're listening to your coworkers, your kids
the main point is when you discuss your thoughts and feelings from a place of empathy
and you listen to others from that same place
you are going to create something that is bigger and better than anything you could have
ever come up with on your own.
that takes vulnerability.

courage to listen to people when they are struggling to communicate their ideas
the courage to be present when they are being vulnerable
