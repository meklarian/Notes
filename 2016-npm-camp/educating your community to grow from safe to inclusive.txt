works at github on the community safety team

slide: safety, diversity, inclusivity

speaker wishes to share some insights found
  tools are not enough

slide: why?

slide: tale of two harassments

on harassment, intent never matters, it's always the impact
what it looks like and what the chance of redemption is

example: somebody submits a PR, and someone else attacks right away with blatant racist remakrs
example: someone submits a PR, and it gets really picked over and while observations may be correct, the volume is overwhelming

response to each one should be very different

first one: ban hammer, just block them, nothing of value being contributed
second one: on microaggression, coaching, help people understand the impact of their actions

when you attack the person directly (confrontation), that person will immediately dig in because your point comes across as an accusation
  even if you are right
  defensive: "no i'm not like that", etc.
instead focus on the impact of their actions
and how the action affected other people

ex. "did you think how your actions came across to this person? how do you think your involvement came across?"

offline example: someone tells a racist joke
almost always a person will defend it immediately
instead, point out an example of how that is harmful to other people

slide: address the actions, address the impact they have, not the person
if we avoid the identity attacks, we can help improve the situation
we all have biases from upbringing, environment, experiences but we can rise above them

slide: build beautiful communities
slide: build beautiful software
