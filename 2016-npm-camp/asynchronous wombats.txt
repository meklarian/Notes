asynchronous wombats

report from colleague
i get an error when i run npm on your registry
thought it was a syntax error and version issue
she followed the steps and it was resolved
but for a global oss codebase, it could take weeks for a resolution

ex: time differences
turnaround time to get a npm debug log
client could be going to bed as support is awake

conversational ball
the same issue that took 10mins to fix with someone sitting next to me could take 26hrs to resolve across the world

language differences
english: hello
dutch: hallo
japanese: (citation needed)

feature requests are much more complicated

new subcommabd
new syntax
update docs
won't fix
etc

complexity = distance by language by network size

asynchronous way
js has promises to handle async situations
